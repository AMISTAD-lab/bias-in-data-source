What's here so far:

## hypothesis_test.py
This file contains several functions to help you run a two-distribution specified complexity (s.c.) hypothesis test for a discrete univariate distribution. This is the user-facing file, and we recommend using it instead of the other files in this directory.

### hypothesis_test
Performs a multinomial SC test.
#### How to use:

### binary_hypothesis_test
Performs a binomial SC test with tighter bounds than hypothesis_test.
#### How to use:

### exact_binomial_test
Performs an exact binomial test. Has the tightest bounds of all the functions listed, but is significantly slower.
#### How to use:
